I am in charge of Portawebia Oy, where I spend my days and most of my nights working on web development and software engineering. My life has not been straightforward. I have been all over the place from internships in Germany to starting my own company always trying to solve real problems with code. When I am not staring at the screen I like to look up at the sky. I am really interested in space and how things work. My big goal is to bring these two things using my programming skills to help people get to the stars.';
